I'm a software engineering student at University Simón Bolívar, Sartenejas, Venezuela.

## projects

I have worked on several projects, most of them for university courses.

### in development

* #### [Sapphire](https://github.com/chamini2/sapphire)
Programming language ***Sapphire***, designed by [germanleonz](https://github.com/germanleonz) and me.
The compiler is being developed in **Haskell**, using *[Alex](https://github.com/simonmar/alex)* and *[Happy](https://github.com/simonmar/happy)*, which is the equivalent of *Flex* and *Bison* in **C++**.
It's still in early development.

* #### [Rubik's Cube](https://github.com/chamini2/rubiks_cube)
Rubik's cube solver developed in **C++**.
Approached using `IDA*` algorithm and *Pattern Databases*.

### past work

* #### [Gas Delivery Simulator](https://github.com/chamini2/gas_delivery_simulator)
Client-server application for simulating gas delivery to gas stations.
Developed in **C** using two different approaches, *Sockets* and *RPC*.

* #### [Rangex](https://gtihub.com/chamini2/rangex)
Interpreter for *fake* programming language Rangex.
Developed in **Python** using *[PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)*.

* #### [Hard drive access simulator](https://github.com/chamini2/disk_simulator)
GUI simulating random access to disk and how the hard drive handles it with the *Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)* scheduling. Developed in **Java** and using *Swing* for the interface.

* #### [Wordsearch](https://github.com/chamini2/wordsearch)
Wordsearch solver developed in **SWI-Prolog**.

## stuff

I consider **[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)** an awesome programming langauge, just take a look at the following example:

~~~haskell
fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
~~~

Now just use your infinite list of Fibonacci numbers, for whatever reason you could need one of those...

~~~haskell
> fibs
[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,...
~~~

*Laziness FTW?*
